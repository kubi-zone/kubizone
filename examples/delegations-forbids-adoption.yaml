# This example shows that if a zone has delegated away responsibility for a
# subzone, it cannot adopt records that rightfully belong in the subzone, even
# if the subzone's own delegation rules don't allow itself to adopt it.
#
# In cases like this where the subzone delegation is specified but not met,
# that is no Zone resources exist that assume responsibility for the subzone,
# the parent zone *will* adopt the records. WARNING: This could be considered
# a bug and might be changed in the future, such that any specified zone delegations
# prevent adoption of records, regardless of whether the delegation is met.

# This zone delegates way responsibility for the subzone "sub", but otherwise
# allows adoption of all child records.
